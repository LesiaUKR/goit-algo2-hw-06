**Introduction**:

Fundamentals of Parallel Computing and the MapReduce Model"
Welcome! ðŸ§ 

In today's world of modern information technology, processing large 
volumes of data requires efficient and fast methods. Your task is to 
write a Python script that applies the MapReduce paradigm to analyze
word frequency in a text and visualize the results.

Completing this homework will help you develop skills in efficiently 
handling large-scale files. It will also provide hands-on experience 
in leveraging Pythonâ€™s parallel computing capabilities to accelerate 
code execution.

## **Task Descriptions**
---

Write a Python script that downloads text from a given URL, analyzes word
frequency using the MapReduce paradigm, and visualizes the most frequently
used words.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Import necessary modules** (e.g., `matplotlib` and others).
2. **Use the provided MapReduce implementation** from the reference notes.
3. Create a function `visualize_top_words` to visualize the results.
4. In the main code block:
   - Fetch text from the URL.
   - Apply the MapReduce paradigm.
   - Visualize the results.

ðŸ‘‰ **For example**, for the top 10 most frequently used words, the graph 
could look like this:

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Code fetches text from the given URL.
- Code performs word frequency analysis using MapReduce.
- Visualization displays the top words by frequency.
- Code uses multithreading for parallel processing.
- Code is readable and adheres to PEP 8 standards.
